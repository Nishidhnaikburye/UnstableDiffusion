# UnstableDiffusion
# Numerical Anslysis of Diffusion using mean value of temperature at nodes having coinciding Boundary Conditons 

# Heat Diffusion Simulation

This Python script simulates heat diffusion in a 2D grid and generates an animation of the temperature distribution along with a plot showing the variation of mean temperature over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `imageio`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib imageio
